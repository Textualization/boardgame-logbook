# boardgame-logbook

This is a simple, standalone PWA built using [go-app](https://github.com/maxence-charriere/go-app).

It keeps track of board game sessions and stores the data in the browser LocalStorage.

The app is currently unskinned and it is missing plenty of functionality, particularly import (and the export is partial).

You can experience the standalone compilation at [https://textualization.github.io/boardgame-logbook/](https://textualization.github.io/boardgame-logbook/). The website is the output of the `make generate` command.
